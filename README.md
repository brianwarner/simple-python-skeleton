# Simple Python starter project

This is a starter template for a simple Python project in VSCode.

## Using this template

You don't have to do much to get this running. Create an environment, write your code, and run it.

If you need to publish to PyPI, you might want to use the [pypi-skeleton](https://github.com/brianwarner/pypi-skeleton) instead.

### Create a Python environment

In VSCode, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`p` (Windows) or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`p` (Mac) and search for "Python: Create Environment...". Take the defaults and install requirements from `requirements.txt`.

### Update the template

Search for `REPLACEME_` and replace it with the correct information.

### Test your code

You can add tests for specific functions in the `tests/` directory. Run the tests like this:

```bash
pytest
```

### Run your code

Open `main.py` and run it within VSCode.
